## Milestone 1 Feedback
* You go back and forth between first- and third-person (a.k.a. sometimes "I" and sometimes "Debbie") in your persona.  You should be consistent.
* Your purpose should be topical, not skills-based.  For example: "The website is a place for me to post info on my ghosthunting activities" instead of about building your technical skills.
* No errors in your HTML validation.  Very nice.
* You've got a few typos and misspellings in here.
* You shouldn't put `<br>` tags manually in your prose text.  It leads to very awkward line breaks at small screen widths, and makes the page harder to maintain.  If you want to reduce the width of your text, use CSS instead.
* You commit and push frequently, which is a good habit.  Some of your commits could be a little smaller, but on balance this is quite good.

Overall, this is a good project.  You've got the technical details down well, and you have a thorough grasp of the point of the project.  There's a few small things that keep this from being a truly next-level project, such as a very basic look and some writing that could be a bit more consistent.  The theme is interesting, and I'm eager to see what direction you go in with this PWP.
**Milestone 1 Grade: Tier III**

## Milestone 2 Feedback
* Your content strategy is clear and concise.  Nice work.
* Your bios should be represented by a longer block of text in your mobile wireframes.  It's going to be tricky to fit those into the space you've allotted them on the mobile version.  Also, where's the name of the person?
* Is there an application process to join the team?  I can't tell, so you'll want to make sure that's clear if that's the nature of your contact form.  Probably you want to gather a bit more info about them.

This is very good work.  Clear, concise, and directed, with an easy-to-follow point for the site, and good-looking wireframes and content that clearly articulate the point of the site.  With early submission, **this milestone grades at a Tier IV.**

## Milestone 4 feedback
Looks good. Design follows your intended content strategy well. You have strong and meaningful commits/pushes that are broken up well. There are some issues with image sizing (carousel) and alignment rendering on mobile/smaller browser viewing. Might consider changing the placeholder text in the form, currently using demo text. This passes Tier III.
