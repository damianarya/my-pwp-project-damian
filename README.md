## Milestone 1 Feedback
* You go back and forth between first- and third-person (a.k.a. sometimes "I" and sometimes "Debbie") in your persona.  You should be consistent.
* Your purpose should be topical, not skills-based.  For example: "The website is a place for me to post info on my ghosthunting activities" instead of about building your technical skills.
* No errors in your HTML validation.  Very nice.
* You've got a few typos and misspellings in here.
* You shouldn't put `<br>` tags manually in your prose text.  It leads to very awkward line breaks at small screen widths, and makes the page harder to maintain.  If you want to reduce the width of your text, use CSS instead.
* You commit and push frequently, which is a good habit.  Some of your commits could be a little smaller, but on balance this is quite good.

Overall, this is a good project.  You've got the technical details down well, and you have a thorough grasp of the point of the project.  There's a few small things that keep this from being a truly next-level project, such as a very basic look and some writing that could be a bit more consistent.  The theme is interesting, and I'm eager to see what direction you go in with this PWP.
