<p> My site will be one page and consist of the following sections.<br>
<br><strong>Welcome</strong> this will be a large picture of my team and I. It will also include the name of the team (N.M.S.P.R.) or New Mexico society of paranormal research for those who like T.L.D.R.
	I want this to be large but not take up the entire screen, I want it to be obvious that there is more below. <br>
<br>
	<div>
	<strong>About us</strong> This section will have an image for every current member of the team as well as a short
	bio in text about each person and what they bring to the team as a whole. It may include more in depth information such
	as how long they have been on the team or witch hunts (that was a pun not a typo) they have been a part of. The background color may be different
	from the preceding and following sections.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Portfolio</strong> This will be my most in depth and interactive section of the page. I intend to put a scrollable
	picture gallery at the top of the section with an image from each hunt my team has done. underneath that i plan to put a
	descriptive text section that details the hunt currently displayed above. this will require that the text change along
	with the pictures above as the user scrolls from one image to the next.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Contact</strong> This section will be set up for fans to contact the group. There will be an email option that will
	go to a group email adress. We will also have a "join the team" option for people who wish to join the fan club by adding
	there name and email for official updates on the teams new adventures. At the bottom of the page there will be a few links
	to other social media sites the group maintains and possibly a youtube link to a page that showcases our vidios. This section
	will be a different color from the preceding one. All disclaimers and "dont do this at home" warnings will be posted between
	the join team area and the links.<br>
