	<strong>purpose</strong>; This website will teach me the tools and give me the experience I need to be a professional web developer.
<br>
	<br>
	<strong>audience</strong>; This webiste is constructed to attract people who enjoys ghost hunting and spooky things.
	<br>
	the target audience is a large group of ghost hunters and wanna be ghost hunters who enjoy viewing or examining
	<br>
	the work of other teams, and hopefully a TV executive or two.
<br>
<br>
	<strong>Goal</strong>; The main goal of this site is to serve as a gallery to showcase and promote my work in the field as well as
	<br>
	the (circumstantial) evidence my team and I collect during our ventures and investigations.

	<h1> Persona</h1>
<br>
<img src="pwpimage.jpg">
<br>
<br>
	<strong>Name</strong>; Debbie Housifgabe
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>age</strong>; 40
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>profession</strong>; Housewife and part time caretaker. I also dabble in continuing education when the subject
	<br>
	suits me. My hobbys include ghost hunting in the summer and excessive holiday decorating but mostly I watch every
	<br>
	episode of the SYFY networks paranormal investigation shows.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Technology</strong>; I am ok with most computers. I can type one hundred and fifty words per minuet but I
	<br>
	dont know alot about these new devices and updates coming out every other month. I can use Youtube, microsoft word
	<br>
	and most web sites like ebay or facebook with ease but I usually let my kids do the really technical stuff like
	<br>
	programming the microwave clock and all the software updates.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Attitudes and Behaviors</strong>; Debbie has a lot of time on her hands what with her kids in high school and her
	<br>
	partner at work all day. She spends a lot of time trying to stay busy. Debbie can get board pretty easily but if
	<br>
	somthing grabs her attention she can focus on it all day and really dive into it. Debbie likes things she can put
	<br>
	down and forget about for a long time but pick back up right where she left off, like an Ann Rice book or that pizza
	<br>
	in the fridge. Oh and she is pritty sure she saw a ghost once.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Frustrations and Needs</strong>; Debbie gets so board, her shows dont air any new episodes in the summer so
	<br>
	she needs something to occupy her time. She really misses her shows but with no new content she is forced to look elsewhere
	<br>
	for her paranormal curiosity needs. She also wants to know if the ghost she saw compares to the ones other people have seen.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Goals</strong>; Debbie wants to get hooked on something that suits her interests with out having to put in a
	<br>
	lot of effort. She doesnt want to have to go out and find a ghost or haunted location herself, she wants to see the
	<br>
	results of that work without having to leave her couch or do any real research on locations or history. Debbie wants
	<br>
	it all presented to her in one neat package.
	<br>
	<br>
	<strong>User Story</strong>; As a user, I want to see the results of paranormal research investigations presented to
	<br>
	me in a way that really pulls me in.
